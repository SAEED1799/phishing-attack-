Project details
This project is designed to attack another device on the network with the help of email We are trying to attack a virtual machine
 so that it is connected to the same network of the machine I am attacking from.
I use the Python script to automatically send an email from the attacker's machine
 to the attacker using the same DNS server that is a local directory that we prepare to perform an attack.
The script is the main thing we run it through a terminal and is responsible for
 a link between us and the attacking machine to send it after they are on the same network connected

the second task 
In this part we will send an email through attachment so that via sending 
we can take the IP and also the name and password of the sender
